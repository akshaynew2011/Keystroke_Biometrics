## Authentication improvement through keystroke 

This project is part of CSEN 5303 Operating Systems graduate coursework . 

The objective of the Keystroke Biometrics Project is to differentiate between the real users and fake user by using their typing rhythms by using a real time dataset.



## How do I run this?

### 1. Setup: Configure R & RStudio

**Step 1:** Download and install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). 

**Step 2:**  Download the dataset in text format from [here](https://github.com/akshaynew2011/Keystroke_Biometrics/blob/master/LockPattern_DATA.txt).

Note:RStudio also supports data formats in csv and excel

**Step 3:**  Download and install required packages for plotting within the RStudio using the GUI.

**Step 4:** Import the downloaded R code into RStudio and run
